\title{Analyse Vessel Counts by Country and Year}
\usage{
analyse_vessel_counts(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', 'UniqueVessels',
and 'AnonVessels' columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising vessel counts by country and year, including total records,
sum of unique vessels, and number of distinct anonymised vessel identifiers. Additionally,
a line plot visualisation of unique vessel counts over time is displayed.
}
\description{
This function analyses the number of unique vessels in a fisheries VMS dataset across
different countries and years, providing insights into fleet dynamics and data completeness.
}
\details{
The function calculates three key metrics for each country and year:
\enumerate{
\item Total number of VMS records
\item Sum of 'UniqueVessels' values (typically 1 for each unique vessel)
\item Count of distinct anonymised vessel identifiers
}

A line plot is created to visualise trends in the number of unique vessels over time
for each country, which can help identify potential fleet changes, data gaps, or
reporting issues.

This analysis is valuable for understanding fishing fleet dynamics, monitoring changes
in fleet size over time, and ensuring completeness in vessel reporting across the dataset.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', 'UniqueVessels', and 'AnonVessels'
columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
The 'UniqueVessels' column typically contains a count of 1 for each unique vessel in a record,
while 'AnonVessels' contains anonymised vessel identifiers.
}
\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with vessel identifiers
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 12),
  year = rep(rep(2018:2021, each = 3), 3),
  UniqueVessels = rep(1, 36),  # Each record represents one unique vessel
  AnonVessels = c(
    paste0("FR", 1:9, pad = "00"), paste0("FR", 7:9, pad = "00"),
    paste0("DK", 1:9, pad = "00"), paste0("DK", 4:6, pad = "00"),
    paste0("GB", 1:9, pad = "00"), paste0("GB", 7:9, pad = "00")
  )
)

# Analyse vessel counts
vessel_counts <- analyse_vessel_counts(vms_data)
print(vessel_counts)
