\title{Analyse Average Interval Between VMS Pings}
\usage{
analyse_average_interval(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country' and 'AverageInterval' columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising average interval statistics by country, including minimum, maximum,
mean, and median values, as well as a classification of the likely time unit used. Additionally,
a histogram visualisation of interval distributions is displayed.
}
\description{
This function analyses the distribution of average intervals between VMS pings
across different countries, helping to identify potential unit inconsistencies
and data quality issues.
}
\details{
The function calculates summary statistics for the average interval between VMS pings by country.
It then attempts to classify the likely time unit (hours vs. minutes) based on the magnitude of
the average interval values.

A histogram is created to visualise the distribution of interval values across different countries,
which can help identify inconsistencies in reporting or potential data quality issues.

This analysis is important because VMS ping frequency affects the accuracy of fishing activity
estimates and can vary between countries due to different regulatory requirements or reporting
conventions. Some countries may report in minutes while others use hours, leading to potential
misinterpretations if not properly accounted for.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country' and 'AverageInterval' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
The function uses basic heuristics to classify time units: values < 5 are likely hours,
values between 5 and 300 are likely minutes, and values > 300 are flagged as suspicious.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with different interval reporting conventions
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = c(rep("FR", 50), rep("DK", 50), rep("GB", 50)),
  AverageInterval = c(
    rnorm(50, 120, 20),   # FR: reporting in minutes (around 2 hours)
    rnorm(50, 2, 0.5),    # DK: reporting in hours (around 2 hours)
    rnorm(50, 60, 10)     # GB: reporting in minutes (around 1 hour)
  )
)

# Analyse average intervals
interval_summary <- analyse_average_interval(vms_data)
print(interval_summary)
