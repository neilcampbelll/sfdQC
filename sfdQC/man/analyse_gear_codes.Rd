\title{Analyse Gear Codes by Country and Year}
\usage{
analyse_gear_codes(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', and
'gear_code' columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising the number of records by country, year, and gear code,
arranged by country, year, and gear code. Additionally, prints a ggplot visualisation
showing the distribution of records across gear codes for each country and year.
}
\description{
This function analyses the distribution of fishing gear codes across different countries
and years in a fisheries VMS dataset, providing both a tabular summary and a visualisation.
}
\details{
The function aggregates VMS data by country, year, and gear code to produce record counts.
The resulting summary is visualised using a faceted bar chart with countries as facets, gear
codes on the x-axis, and years differentiated by colour. This analysis helps identify fishing
method patterns and potential data quality issues in gear code reporting.

In fisheries management, understanding the distribution of fishing gears is important for
estimating fishing impact on different habitats and stocks. Common gear codes include OTB
(otter trawl bottom), PTM (pelagic pair trawl), DRB (dredge), and others defined in the
Data Collection Framework.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', and 'gear_code' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with various gear codes
vms_data <- data.frame(
  ID = paste0("ID", 1:12),
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 4),
  year = rep(c(2009, 2010), 6),
  gear_code = rep(c("OTB", "PTM", "DRB", "OTM"), 3),
  fishing_hours = runif(12, 0.5, 12)
)

# Analyse gear code distribution
gear_summary <- analyse_gear_codes(vms_data)
head(gear_summary)
