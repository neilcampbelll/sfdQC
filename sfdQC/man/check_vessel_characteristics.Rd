\title{Cross-check Vessel Characteristics Against Expected Ranges}
\usage{
check_vessel_characteristics(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', 'vessel_length_category',
'avg_oal', and 'avg_kw' columns.}
}
\value{
If mismatches are found, returns a list containing a summary of mismatches by country
and vessel category, and a sample of mismatched records. Also displays a bar chart visualisation
of mismatches. If no mismatches are found, returns a character string indicating this.
}
\description{
This function cross-checks vessel length and power characteristics against expected ranges
based on vessel length categories, identifying potential mismatches or data quality issues.
}
\details{
The function first defines expected ranges for vessel length and power based on standard
vessel length categories (e.g., VL0010, VL1012, etc.). It then joins these expected ranges
with the VMS data and identifies records where the actual length or power falls outside
the expected range for the assigned category.

A bar chart is created to visualise the distribution of mismatches across different vessel
length categories and countries, helping to identify systematic issues in vessel characteristic
reporting.

This analysis is important for ensuring consistency between vessel length categories and the
actual reported vessel characteristics, which is crucial for accurate fleet segmentation and
fishing capacity assessments.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', 'vessel_length_category', 'avg_oal',
and 'avg_kw' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr, tibble, and ggplot2 packages.
The function uses predefined expected ranges based on standard EU vessel length categories.

# Create sample VMS data with some vessel characteristic mismatches
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 3),
  year = rep(2020, 9),
  vessel_length_category = rep(c("VL0010", "VL1218", "VL2440"), 3),
  avg_oal = c(8, 15, 30, 9, 20, 42, 12, 16, 22),  # GB VL2440 is too small
  avg_kw = c(100, 300, 700, 120, 450, 900, 150, 350, 500)  # GB VL2440 has low power
)

# Check vessel characteristics
