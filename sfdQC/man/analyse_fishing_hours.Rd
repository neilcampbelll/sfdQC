\title{Analyse Fishing Hours Distribution}
\usage{
analyse_fishing_hours(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country' and 'fishing_hours' columns.}
}
\value{
A list containing four ggplot objects (distribution plot, violin plot, mean/median plot,
and total hours plot) and a summary statistics data frame. All plots are also saved as PNG files
in the working directory.
}
\description{
This function provides a comprehensive analysis of fishing hours distributions across
different countries in a fisheries VMS dataset, including various summary statistics
and visualisations.
}
\details{
The function first calculates summary statistics for fishing hours by country, including the
total, mean, median, minimum, and maximum values. It then creates four different visualisations:
\enumerate{
\item A histogram showing the distribution of fishing hours by country
\item A violin plot comparing the distributions across countries
\item A bar chart comparing mean and median fishing hours by country
\item A bar chart showing the total fishing hours by country
}

These visualisations help identify potential data quality issues, such as unrealistic fishing
hours values or inconsistencies between countries. They also provide insights into fishing
patterns and effort distribution.

The function focuses on records with reasonable fishing hours (between 0 and 24 hours), filtering
out potentially erroneous values.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country' and 'fishing_hours' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 packages.
The function saves four PNG files in the working directory.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with fishing hours
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 100),
  fishing_hours = c(
    runif(100, 0, 12),  # FR: uniform distribution 0-12
    c(runif(80, 1, 4), runif(20, 8, 12)),  # DK: bimodal distribution
    c(rnorm(100, 6, 2))  # GB: normal distribution around 6
  )
)

# Analyse fishing hours
result <- analyse_fishing_hours(vms_data)
print(result$fishing_hour_stats)
