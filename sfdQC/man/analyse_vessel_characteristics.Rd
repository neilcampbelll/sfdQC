\title{Analyse Vessel Power and Length Characteristics}
\usage{
analyse_vessel_characteristics(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', 'avg_kw',
and 'avg_oal' columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising vessel power and length statistics by country and year, including
flagged percentages for potentially problematic values. Additionally, histogram visualisations
of power and length distributions are displayed.
}
\description{
This function analyses vessel power (kW) and overall length (OAL) characteristics in a
fisheries VMS dataset, identifying potential data quality issues and visualising
distributions across countries and years.
}
\details{
The function first categorises vessel power (kW) and length (OAL) values into status groups:
NA, Zero, Negative, Suspicious (unusually high values), or Normal. It then calculates the
percentage of records in each category by country and year.

Two histograms are created to visualise the distribution of "normal" values for both vessel power
and length, faceted by country and year. These visualisations help identify patterns, outliers,
or inconsistencies in vessel characteristics data.

This analysis is important for quality control of VMS data, as vessel characteristics affect
fishing capacity estimates and are used in effort calculations and fleet segmentation.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', 'avg_kw', and 'avg_oal' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
Values above 5000 kW for power or 120 m for length are flagged as potentially suspicious.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with vessel characteristics
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 3),
  year = rep(c(2019, 2020, 2021), 3),
  avg_kw = c(250, 300, 400, 350, 450, 550, 500, 600, 700),
  avg_oal = c(15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40)
)

# Analyse vessel characteristics
vessel_summary <- analyse_vessel_characteristics(vms_data)
print(vessel_summary)
