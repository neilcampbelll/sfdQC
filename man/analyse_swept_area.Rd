\title{Analyse Swept Area Information}
\usage{
analyse_swept_area(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', and 'SweptArea' columns.}
}
\value{
A list containing summary tables and plots: a summary table of swept area statistics by country
and year, a table of data quality metrics by country, and four visualisations highlighting different
aspects of the swept area data. All plots are also saved as PNG files in the working directory.
}
\description{
This function provides a comprehensive analysis of swept area information in a fisheries VMS dataset,
evaluating data quality, completeness, and distributional characteristics across countries and years.
}
\details{
The function performs a multi-faceted analysis of swept area data:
\enumerate{
\item It first creates a comprehensive summary of swept area data by country and year, including
completeness metrics, statistics for non-zero values, and flags for potential unit inconsistencies.
\item It generates a data quality summary highlighting countries with problematic data (missing or zero values).
\item It attempts to standardise units across countries, converting values to square kilometers based
on the magnitude of the values.
\item It produces four visualisations:
\itemize{
\item A tile plot showing data quality issues by country and year
\item A bar chart showing the proportion of problematic data by country
\item A histogram showing the distribution of swept area by gear type
\item A heatmap showing average swept area by country and year
}
}

This analysis is crucial for quality control of swept area data, which is a key indicator of
fishing pressure on the seabed. It helps identify inconsistencies in reporting units, missing data,
and other quality issues that need to be addressed before using the data for scientific assessments.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', and 'SweptArea' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
The function saves four PNG files in the working directory.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with swept area information
# Some countries report in sq. meters, others in sq. kilometers
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB", "ES"), each = 50),
  year = rep(rep(c(2019, 2020), each = 25), 4),
  gear_code = rep(c("OTB", "OTB", "DRB", "OTB"), each = 50),
  SweptArea = c(
    rnorm(50, 2000000, 500000),  # FR: sq. meters
    rnorm(50, 2, 0.5),           # DK: sq. kilometers
    sample(c(NA, runif(30, 3, 10)), 50, replace = TRUE),  # GB: some missing values
    rep(NA, 50)                  # ES: all missing
  )
)

# Analyse swept area
# swept_analysis <- analyse_swept_area(vms_data)
