\title{Check for Unique IDs in a Fisheries VMS Dataset}
\usage{
check_unique_ids(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with an ID column to be checked for uniqueness.}
}
\value{
If duplicate IDs are found, returns a tibble with duplicate IDs and their count,
sorted in descending order by count. If no duplicates are found, returns a character string
indicating that no duplicates were detected.
}
\description{
This function examines a fisheries VMS dataset to identify whether it contains any duplicate ID values.
It provides a summary count of total rows, unique IDs, and duplicate IDs in the console.
If duplicates are found, it returns a tibble containing the duplicate IDs and their frequency.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{dplyr} package for data manipulation. It first counts the total
number of rows and unique IDs, then prints these values to the console along with the
number of duplicate IDs (if any). For datasets with duplicate IDs, it returns a tibble
showing which IDs appear multiple times and how many occurrences there are of each.

VMS data integrity is critical for fishing effort analyses, and this function helps ensure
that each record has a unique identifier.
}
\note{
The function assumes that the ID column is named "ID" in the input dataset.
