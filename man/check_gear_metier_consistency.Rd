\title{Check for Consistency Between Gear Codes and Métiers}
\usage{
check_gear_metier_consistency(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', 'gear_code',
and 'LE_MET_level6' columns.}
}
\value{
If inconsistencies are found, returns a list containing a summary of inconsistencies by
country, gear code, and métier, and a sample of inconsistent records. Also displays a bar chart
visualisation of inconsistencies. If no inconsistencies are found, returns a character string
indicating this.
}
\description{
This function checks for consistency between gear codes and the corresponding métier classifications
in a fisheries VMS dataset, identifying records where these do not match.
}
\details{
The function first defines expected mappings between gear codes and métier prefixes (e.g., gear code
"OTB" should correspond to métiers starting with "OTB_"). It then identifies records where the
métier prefix does not match the corresponding gear code.

A bar chart is created to visualise the distribution of inconsistencies across different gear codes
and countries, helping to identify systematic issues in gear and métier reporting.

This analysis is important for ensuring integrity and consistency in fishing activity classification,
which is crucial for accurate fishing effort and impact assessments.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', 'gear_code', and 'LE_MET_level6' columns
in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr, tibble, stringr, and ggplot2 packages.
The function uses predefined mappings based on standard DCF gear codes and métier classifications.

# Create sample VMS data with some gear-métier inconsistencies
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 3),
  year = rep(2020, 9),
  gear_code = rep(c("OTB", "PTM", "DRB"), 3),
