\title{Analyse Records by Year and Country in VMS Data}
\usage{
records_by_year_country(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country' and 'year' columns.}
}
\value{
A wide-format tibble showing the count of records for each country-year combination,
with countries as rows and years as columns. Additionally, prints a ggplot visualisation
showing the trend of record counts over time for each country.
}
\description{
This function analyses fisheries VMS data to summarise the number of records by year and country,
providing both a tabular summary and a time series visualisation.
}
\details{
The function aggregates VMS data by country and year to produce record counts. It returns
this information in a wide format table and also creates a line plot showing temporal trends
for each country. This visualisation is useful for identifying potential data gaps or
unusual patterns in data submission across years.

Temporal analysis of records is essential for assessing the consistency and completeness
of VMS data reporting across different countries and time periods.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country' and 'year' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 packages.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data spanning multiple years and countries
vms_data <- data.frame(
  ID = paste0("ID", 1:12),
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB", "ES"), each = 3),
  year = rep(c(2009, 2010, 2011), 4),
  c_square = paste0("Square", 1:12),
  fishing_hours = runif(12, 0.5, 12)
)

# Analyse records by year and country
yearly_summary <- records_by_year_country(vms_data)
print(yearly_summary)
