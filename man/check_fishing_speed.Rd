\title{Check ICES Average Fishing Speed in VMS Data}
\usage{
check_fishing_speed(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with an 'ICES_avg_fishing_speed' column.}
}
\value{
A summary of ICES average fishing speed by country is printed to the console. If non-NA
values are found, the function returns these records. Additionally, if sufficient non-NA values
exist, the function generates a histogram showing the distribution of values by country.
}
\description{
This function examines the availability and distribution of ICES average fishing speed values
in a fisheries VMS dataset, providing both summary statistics and visualisations.
}
\details{
The function first summarises the presence/absence of ICES average fishing speed data by country,
calculating the percentage of NA values. It then examines any non-NA values in more detail,
providing a sample of these records and, if sufficient data exists, a visualisation of their
distribution. This information can be useful for quality control and for understanding the
availability of standardised fishing speed information.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of an 'ICES_avg_fishing_speed' column in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with some ICES fishing speed values
vms_data <- data.frame(
  ID = paste0("ID", 1:6),
  country = c("FR", "DK", "FR", "ES", "GB", "DK"),
  year = c(2012, 2009, 2018, 2013, 2009, 2009),
  ICES_avg_fishing_speed = c(NA, 3.2, NA, 3.5, NA, 2.8)
)

# Check ICES fishing speed information
speed_info <- check_fishing_speed(vms_data)
print(speed_info)
