\title{Analyse Data Submission Patterns by Country}
\usage{
analyse_submissions_pattern(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', and
'importDate' columns.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames: a detailed summary of submissions by country,
year, and import date, and a summary of resubmission patterns. Additionally, a line plot
visualisation of submission patterns is displayed.
}
\description{
This function analyses patterns in data submission over time for different countries
and years in a fisheries VMS dataset, helping to identify resubmissions and gaps.
}
\details{
The function first creates a summary of data by country, year, and import date, counting
the number of records submitted on each date. It then visualises these submission patterns
over time using a line plot, with countries as facets and years differentiated by color.

A resubmission analysis is also performed, identifying the total number of submissions,
the latest submission date, and the total number of records for each country and year.

This analysis is valuable for monitoring data submission compliance, identifying countries
with delayed or missing submissions, and tracking the frequency of data updates or corrections.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', and 'importDate' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
The importDate column should be in a format that can be converted to Date.

\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with various import dates
vms_data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "ES"), each = 100),
  year = rep(c(2019, 2020), each = 50, times = 3),
  importDate = c(
    rep("2020-05-15", 50), rep("2021-06-20", 50),  # FR
    rep("2020-04-10", 50), rep("2021-05-05", 50),  # DK
    rep("2020-06-30", 50), rep(NA, 50)            # ES: missing recent submission
  )
)

# Analyse submission patterns
submission_analysis <- analyse_submissions_pattern(vms_data)
print(submission_analysis$resubmission_summary)
