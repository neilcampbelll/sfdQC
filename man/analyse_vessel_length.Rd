\title{Analyse Vessel Length Categories by Country and Year}
\usage{
analyse_vessel_length(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'country', 'year', and
'vessel_length_category' columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising the number of records by country, year, and vessel length category,
arranged by country, year, and vessel length category. Additionally, prints a ggplot visualisation
showing the distribution of records across vessel length categories for each country and year.
}
\description{
This function analyses the distribution of vessel length categories across different countries
and years in a fisheries VMS dataset, providing both a tabular summary and a visualisation.
}
\details{
The function aggregates VMS data by country, year, and vessel length category to produce record counts.
The resulting summary is visualised using a faceted bar chart with countries as facets, vessel length
categories on the x-axis, and years differentiated by color. This analysis helps identify fleet
composition patterns and potential data quality issues in vessel length reporting.

In fisheries management, understanding the distribution of vessel lengths is important for
effort estimation and capacity assessment. Unusual patterns may indicate data quality issues
that require further investigation.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'country', 'year', and 'vessel_length_category' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
Standard vessel length categories in VMS data typically follow the format VL0010, VL1012, etc.,
indicating vessel length ranges in meters.
}
\examples{
# Create sample VMS data with various vessel length categories
vms_data <- data.frame(
  ID = paste0("ID", 1:12),
  country = rep(c("FR", "DK", "GB"), each = 4),
  year = rep(c(2009, 2010), 6),
  vessel_length_category = rep(c("VL0010", "VL1012", "VL1518", "VL1824"), 3),
  fishing_hours = runif(12, 0.5, 12)
)

# Analyse vessel length distribution
length_summary <- analyse_vessel_length(vms_data)
head(length_summary)
