\title{Analyse Fishing Speed by Métier}
\usage{
analyse_fishing_speed_by_metier(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing VMS data with 'LE_MET_level6' and 'avg_fishing_speed' columns.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects displaying fishing speed distributions for different gear groups
and target species groups. The plots are also saved as PNG files in the working directory.
}
\description{
This function conducts a detailed analysis of fishing speeds across different métiers in a
fisheries VMS dataset, creating visualisations grouped by gear type and target species.
}
\details{
The function first identifies the most common métiers in the dataset (those with more than 1000 records).
It then extracts the main gear code and target species from each métier, and groups gear codes into
logical categories (bottom trawls, pelagic trawls, seines, dredges, and passive gears).

For each gear group, the function creates a plot showing the median fishing speed, along with the
25th and 75th percentiles, for each métier within the group. Similar plots are also created for
métiers grouped by target species (DEF, SPF, CRU, MOL, DWS).

This analysis is valuable for quality control, as fishing speeds outside the expected range for
a given gear type or métier may indicate data quality issues. It also provides useful reference
values for estimating fishing activity from VMS data.
}
\note{
The function assumes the presence of 'LE_MET_level6' and 'avg_fishing_speed' columns in the input dataset.
The function requires the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.
The plots are saved as PNG files with names based on the gear group or target species.
}
\examples{
# This function works with a large dataset with multiple métiers
# Here is a simplified example:
metiers <- c("OTB_DEF_70-99_0_0", "PTM_SPF_16-31_0_0", "DRB_MOL_0_0_0")
vms_data <- data.frame(
  LE_MET_level6 = sample(metiers, 3000, replace = TRUE),
  avg_fishing_speed = runif(3000, 2, 5)
)

# Analyse fishing speeds by métier
# Note: In practice, you would need many more records per métier
# plots <- analyse_fishing_speed_by_metier(vms_data)
